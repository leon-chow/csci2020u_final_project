beta branch has all our work, and beta branch is the default.

Instructions to run this project:

In IntelliJ press the player button, or compile and run the program in command line which will
have both the client and server running (To only run only client comment out line 253-260), (To run only server comment out line 263-277). You can separate the client and server to open on a Lan connection. Game is only for local play.

Project includes:
File IO that reads how to play and credits page and writes to GameLengths File
Sockets to handle chatting between server and client
multi-threading to have the chat run on a different thread and not interfere with gameplay
Option Sliders for volume and brightness
Stores number of turns each game in a text file: gameLengths.txt
